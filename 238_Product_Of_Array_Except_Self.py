# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            answer[i] = answer[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
        R = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] = answer[i] * R
            R *= nums[i]
        return answer
